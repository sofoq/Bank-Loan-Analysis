# 🏦 Bank Loan Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This **Tableau** project analyzes bank loan applications for the year **2021**, providing insights into key financial metrics and trends. The dashboard dynamically updates based on user selections and allows for in-depth exploration of loan data.  

## 📊 Key Dashboards  

### **1️⃣ Summary Sheet**  
This sheet presents an overview of key performance indicators (**KPIs**) with **Month-to-Date (MTD)** and **Month-over-Month (MOM)** comparisons:  
- **Total Loan Applications**  
- **Total Funded Amount**  
- **Total Amount Received**  
- **Average Interest Rate**  
- **Average DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)**  

**Important:**  
- The **main KPIs** display the total values for the entire year (**2021**).  
- **MTD and MOM** values reflect only the difference between the most recent month and the previous month.  

Additionally, this sheet includes:  
- **Donut Charts**:  
  - 📊 **Good Loans**: Total applications, funded amount, and received amount.  
  - 📊 **Bad Loans**: Total applications, funded amount, and received amount.  
- **Matrix for Loan Status**: Displays detailed KPIs for each loan status.  

### **2️⃣ Overview Sheet**  
This sheet allows users to select a measure (**Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, or Total Received Amount**) using a slicer. All visualizations update dynamically based on the selected measure:  
- 📈 **Area Chart** – Monthly trend of the selected measure.  
- 🗺️ **Map by State** – Displays regional distribution of loans.  
- 🍩 **Donut Chart by Term** – Breakdown of loan terms.  
- 📊 **Clustered Bar Chart by Employee Length** – Shows loan applications by employment duration.  
- 📊 **Clustered Bar Chart by Purpose** – Displays loan distribution by purpose.  
- 🔥 **Heatmap by Home Ownership** – Analyzes homeownership trends in relation to loans.  

When a measure is selected, every chart updates to reflect data specifically for that measure.
